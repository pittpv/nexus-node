# üõ∞Ô∏è Nexus Multi-Node Setup with Docker Compose, Watchtower & Telegram Alerts

You can choose **automatic installation via script** or **manual setup**.

---

## ‚ö°Ô∏è Option 1: Automatic Installation (Recommended) - Supports Multiple Nodes

![Nexus Multi-Node Setup](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pittpv/nexus-node/refs/heads/main/other/img-2025-07-01-16-55-28.png)

Just run this one-liner in your terminal (first install or update):

```bash
curl -o nexus3.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pittpv/nexus-node/refs/heads/main/nexus3.sh && chmod +x nexus3.sh && ./nexus3.sh
```

For future runs:

```bash
cd $HOME && ./nexus3.sh
```

When installing the node(s), the script will:

* Ask for your Telegram `TG_TOKEN`, `TG_CHAT_ID` and validate it;
* Ask for batch `NODE_ID` upload or manual entry;
* Create separate `nexus-nodes/` and `watchtower/` directories in your `$HOME`;
* Set up `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` for Nexus;
* Set up `.env` and `docker-compose.yml` for Watchtower;
* Let you start/stop/remove containers via an interactive menu.

> If Watchtower is already configured, the script will ask before overwriting.

    - Supports navigation between tmux sessions when dealing with more nodes. One tmux session = 4 containers.
    - Convenient usage instructions displayed right before launching log viewing. Exit log viewing with `Ctrl+B` then `D`.
- Minor UX improvements

### 04-07-2025
- Added a function to check machine resources and calculate recommended value for --max-threads parameter. Thanks to **@leznoxx** (Discord) for the function idea
- Updated main menu order

## ‚öôÔ∏è Option 2: Manual Setup - One node setup

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Prerequisite:**
> Make sure **Docker** and **Docker Compose** are installed on your system.
> You can follow [this guide to install Docker and dependencies](https://github.com/pittpv/sepolia-auto-install/blob/main/en/Install-Dependecies.md) if you don't have it installed yet.

---

### üìÅ Step 1: Create Nexus Directory

```bash
mkdir nexus && cd nexus
```

---

### üê≥ Step 2: Pull the Latest Nexus Image

```bash
docker pull nexusxyz/nexus-cli:latest
```

---

### üîç Step 3: Obtain Your Node ID

1. [Open the Nexus web app](https://app.nexus.xyz/nodes) in your browser and Sign in.
2. Click **Add Node** ‚Üí **Add CLI node**.
3. Copy your **Node ID** ‚Äì it will look like a long alphanumeric string.

---

### üìÑ Step 4: Create `docker-compose.yml` for Nexus

Inside the `nexus/` directory, create:

```yaml
services:
  nexus-cli:
    container_name: nexus
    restart: unless-stopped
    image: nexusxyz/nexus-cli:latest
    init: true
    command: start --node-id NODE_ID
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
    labels:
      - com.centurylinklabs.watchtower.enable=true
```

> üîÅ Replace `NODE_ID` with the value you copied in Step 3.

---

### üìÅ Step 5: Create Watchtower Directory

```bash
mkdir watchtower && cd watchtower
```

---

### üìÑ Step 6: Create `docker-compose.yml` for Watchtower

```yaml
services:
  watchtower:
    image: containrrr/watchtower
    container_name: watchtower
    restart: unless-stopped
    volumes:
      - /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock
    environment:
      - WATCHTOWER_CLEANUP=true
      - WATCHTOWER_POLL_INTERVAL=3600
      - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATIONS=shoutrrr
      - WATCHTOWER_NOTIFICATION_URL=telegram://TG_TOKEN@telegram?channels=TG_CHAT_ID
      - WATCHTOWER_INCLUDE_RESTARTING=true
      - WATCHTOWER_LABEL_ENABLE=true
```

> üõ°Ô∏è Replace `TG_TOKEN` and `TG_CHAT_ID` with your **Telegram bot token** and **chat ID**.

---

### üöÄ Step 7: Launch Both Containers

From each folder (`nexus/` and `watchtower/`), run:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

---

## üîß Useful Docker Commands

```bash
# Show running containers
docker ps -a

# Show watchtower logs
docker logs -f watchtower

# Show Nexus logs (for one node setup)
docker attach nexus

# Exit from container viewer (for one node setup)
Ctrl+P then Ctrl+Q

# tmux exit from container viewer
Ctrl+B then D

# Restart a container
docker restart nexus

# Stop and remove containers
docker compose down

# Recreate containers
docker compose up -d

```

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### 1. `permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket` on WSL

**Cause:** Your user is not part of the `docker` group.

**Solution:**
Run the following command and restart the terminal (WSL):

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
```

---

### 2. Nexus container keeps restarting

**Cause:** Not enough RAM available.

**Solution:**
* Use latest update of Nexus
* Run the node on a machine with more available memory.
* Partial workaround:
  * Create a swap file
  * Increase `ulimit` limits

You can do both using **option 7** and **option 8** in the script.

---

## ‚úÖ Done!

Your Nexus node is now:

‚úÖ Running via Docker Compose

‚úÖ Automatically updated via Watchtower

‚úÖ Sending update notifications to Telegram

Enjoy smooth and reliable operation! üöÄ
